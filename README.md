## [SSLab](sslab.md)

SSLab represents the [Systems Software & Security Lab](https://gts3.org/) from Georgia Institute of Technology led by [Prof. Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/).

We have been actively working on SGX related research. These research projects can be broadly classified into three different categories: System Design, Defense, and Attack.

* Please take a look at our achievements on Attacks and Defenses for Intel SGX \(download link blow\). Demo videos can be viewed under [SGX Bootstrap/CCS17 Tutorial](sgx-bootstrap/ccs17-tutorial.md).
